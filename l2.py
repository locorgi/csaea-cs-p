# Variables store any kind of information .
# Make sure to use descriptive variables names. 
# Note that variables can be overwritten

# variable name convention for booleans
isComplete = False
isEnabled = False
isAwake = True

# math conventions:
x = 3.14
y = 8
print(x + y)

# variables are flexible. you create or update another variable, like so:
count = 10 
print(count)
count_down = count - 1
print(count_down)
count = count_down
print(count)
count = count + count
print(count)

# Challenge 1: Rename Variables  
# Change the variable names x, y, z below to more descriptive names. 

x = "Radia Perlman"
y = 34
z = "Networking Engineer"

# Challenge 2: Update Variables  
# Create a variable called 'count' with a value of 10.  
# Use another variable to increase 'count' by 5
# Print the result

# Challenge 3: Swap Variables  
# Given variables num = 4 and y = "hello".  
# Swap the values so that num = "hello" and y = 4. 
# Use a temporary variable.  
# Hint: You will need to create one new variable. 


a = 10
b = 5
a += b
print(a)
temp=0
temp = a
b = a
temp = b
